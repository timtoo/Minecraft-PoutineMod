# PoutineMod #

A simple Forge-based mod to add the glories of [poutine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poutine) to Minecraft.
The poutine is craftable, as are its ingredients.


### What's in the mod? ###

* __Cheese Curds__ - *milk + vines* (vines might be a vegetable source of [rennet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rennet#Vegetable_rennet), right?)
* __Gravy__ - *bowl + 2 brown mushrooms* (like mushroom stew, but browner)
* __Sliced Potatos__ - *2 potatos* (makes a good amount of fries, hopefully)
* __Fries__ - *sliced potatos* cooked in an oven (until deep friers are invented)
* __Poutine__ - *Fries*, covered in *Cheese Curds*, smothered in *Gravy*. Disgustingly good.

Poutine is very filling.

### How to try the mod? ###

A pre-build jar file should be available in the download area of the bitbucket respository,
ready to be dropped in your Minecraft Forge mods folder.


### How to use the source? ###

The source code provided is the everything under the "src" directory of an eclipse project
set up as described by the Minecraft Forge documentation. It uses **gradle** to build the jar
file.

You will have to edit the *build.gradle* file with the following (or similar) information:

    version = "1.7.10-1.0"
    group= "ca.xxvii.minecraft.poutinemod"
    archivesBaseName = "PoutineModID"
